Introduction to Text and Data Mining

This is an introductory course primarily intended for research support administrative staff, but others such as researchers, librarians and repository managers may also find this introductory course useful. 

In this Github page you will not be able to find the course - this is available [here](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/learning/introduction-to-text-and-data-mining/). 

Nonetheless, here you will be able to find and download locally all the Python files relating to the practical activities of the course and more specifically the "Text mining practical activities using the CORE API". 

The files should be viewed in the following order: 
1. Get organised before you get started
2. Text and Data Mining fundamentals
3. Examples using the CORE API
4. Help page on the CORE API exercise
